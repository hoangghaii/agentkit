# MCP integration

Verified 2026-10-28 against the official [MCP guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp).

Project-scoped server configuration lives at root `.mcp.json` with a `mcpServers` object. It is separate from Claude lifecycle settings. Example optional HTTP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {"type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"}
  }
}
```

Review and approve project servers in the host. AgentKit supplies optional templates but does not enable a server or require a service API key for core workflows. Keep real credentials in appropriate external/environment configuration, and inspect the server's current auth requirements before use.

Once connected, discover relevant host tools and read their schemas. Use those tools directly rather than installing a second client merely to reach a server already exposed by the host. Read-only capabilities can still require server-side permissions; report missing access instead of fabricating results.

For troubleshooting, inspect `/mcp`, project trust, the actual config scope, process startup or URL connectivity, auth state and tool availability. Preserve technical protocol notifications such as tool/resource updates. Do not configure an unrelated proxy, symlink another host's settings or silently install external servers to work around missing access.
