# Claude project skills and roles

Verified 2026-10-28 against [skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) and the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

A project skill lives at `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with YAML frontmatter containing `name` and `description`. Keep the directory and skill names aligned. Supporting scripts, references and assets stay beside the entrypoint; resolve their paths relative to that directory. A separate JSON discovery manifest is not required.

```yaml
---
name: example-review
description: Review a specific project artifact when its specialized checks are needed.
---
```

This snippet illustrates metadata, not a complete skill. Make the description discriminate the task from neighboring skills; keep deep procedures in linked references. Test real requests that should and should not activate it. Use `kit-skill-authoring` for creating/importing or repairing a skill.

Roles live in `.claude/agents/*.md`. Define a concise description, responsibility, input/output handoff and permitted work. AgentKit omits model overrides and gives read-only roles only the tools needed for evidence. A read-only planner returns proposed per-file contents for the coordinator to persist. Tool availability does not expand user authorization.

Legacy command aliases in `.claude/commands/` route to installed kit skills with explicit mode parameters. Inspect the generated alias before assuming its behavior. For example, brainstorming is `kit-plan --brainstorm`, while implementation planning creates an overview and phase files. Ordinary diagnostic and test commands report by default; repairs require an implementation request.
