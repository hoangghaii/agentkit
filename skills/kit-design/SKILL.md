# kit-design

Inspect the target screen, product requirements and existing design system. Choose responsive layouts, accessible controls and useful loading, empty and error states. Preserve the requested visual reference and real product constraints.

- `--fast`: deliver one focused design/implementation pass using existing tokens and components, then verify affected interactions and responsive behavior.
- `--good`: investigate the relevant visual/UX choices more deeply, refine hierarchy/spacing/typography and states, and iterate against browser evidence. Additional exploration must justify its cost.
- `--screenshot`: use the supplied screenshot as the design reference.
- `--describe`: provide a detailed screenshot/video design description, then create a persisted implementation overview and phase files using `planning` conventions. Describe layout, elements, states/interactions, typography, spacing, color and visual effects, distinguishing measurements from estimates. Return the plan path without implementing UI unless that is also authorized.
- `--3d`: use Three.js when the task calls for interactive 3D.
- `--video`: analyze the supplied product demo/reference video for the requested design work.

Use available host/browser tools and relevant design skills. External asset generation is optional, not a mandatory service. Wait for an app-specific element or response before inspecting dynamic UI. Hand off changed paths, screenshots or other useful evidence, checks and unresolved limitations.

Read existing design guidelines. During authorized implementation, update the established design-guidelines document for new reusable tokens/patterns and record substantial rationale in the active plan report. Verify glyph coverage and fallback fonts for the requested language, explicitly including Vietnamese diacritics when applicable. Do not assume a familiar font supports them.

For `--screenshot`, `--video` and `--3d`, inspect the reference/requirements, persist an appropriately sized overview and phase files, implement within the authorized design task, and verify the result. Follow an existing relevant plan rather than duplicating it. `--describe` stops after description and planning unless implementation is also requested.
