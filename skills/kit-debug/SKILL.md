# kit-debug

Investigate and report by default. Read the supplied issue, logs and affected paths, reproduce the failure when possible, and form a falsifiable root-cause hypothesis. Trace inputs, state and boundaries; distinguish observations from assumptions.

Use `debugger` for substantial diagnostic work when available, or investigate directly. Return the reproduction, evidence, root cause, affected files, proposed correction and a verification plan. If a read-only role cannot obtain runtime/log evidence, the coordinator gathers it and supplies the result.

Do not edit application code, configuration or tests merely because `/debug` was invoked. Apply repairs through `kit-fix` or an explicit user request to investigate and fix; the coordinating agent performs authorized edits after diagnosis. Do not use network/service credentials unless the task needs that capability.
