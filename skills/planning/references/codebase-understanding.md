# Codebase Understanding Phase

**When to skip:** If provided with scout reports, skip this phase.

## Core Activities

### Scoped Discovery
Search the relevant source directly for a small task. For a large unfamiliar codebase, delegate independent discovery scopes to scouts when useful and available; otherwise inspect sequentially. Do not require platform-specific slash commands.

### Documentation Review
Read the project instructions and README when present. Inspect existing development rules, codebase summary, code standards and design guidelines that are relevant to the task. Follow the paths actually used by the project; common locations include `workflows/development-rules.md` and `docs/`.

Missing documentation is not a blocker by itself. Infer conventions from the source, record material assumptions, and do not create unrelated documentation just to satisfy a checklist.

### Environment Analysis
- Review development environment setup
- Review configuration and environment-variable names through examples; avoid reading or exposing real credentials unless the task requires it
- Identify required dependencies
- Understand build and deployment processes

### Pattern Recognition
- Study existing patterns in codebase
- Identify conventions and architectural decisions
- Note consistency in implementation approaches
- Understand error handling patterns

### Integration Planning
- Identify how new features integrate with existing architecture
- Map dependencies between components
- Understand data flow and state management
- Consider backward compatibility

## Best Practices

- Start with documentation before diving into code
- Use scouts for targeted file discovery
- Document patterns found for consistency
- Note any inconsistencies or technical debt
- Consider impact on existing features
