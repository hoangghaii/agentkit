# Research & Analysis Phase

**When to skip:** If provided with researcher reports, skip this phase.

## Core Activities

### Research Scope
- Research only uncertainty that affects the requested plan; a small, understood task may need no external research.
- Use host-native tools directly. Delegate substantial independent questions to researchers only when delegation is available and useful; otherwise work sequentially.
- Integrate required research results before deciding the approach.

### Sequential Thinking
- Use `sequential-thinking` skill for dynamic and reflective problem-solving
- Structured thinking process for complex analysis
- Enables multi-step reasoning with revision capability

### Documentation Research
- Use `docs-seeker` skill to read and understand documentation
- Research plugins, packages, and frameworks
- Find latest technical documentation using llms.txt standard

### GitHub Analysis
- Use `gh` command to read and analyze:
  - GitHub Actions logs
  - Pull requests
  - Issues and discussions
- Extract relevant technical context from GitHub resources

### Remote Repository Analysis
When a supplied repository needs a summary and Repomix is available, it can be used optionally:
```bash
# usage: 
repomix --remote <github-repo-url>
# example:
repomix --remote https://github.com/upstash/context7
```

### Debugger Delegation
- Delegate substantial diagnostic work to `debugger` when available; investigate directly otherwise
- Use when investigating complex issues or bugs
- Debugger agent specializes in diagnostic tasks

## Best Practices

- Research breadth before depth
- Document findings for synthesis phase
- Identify multiple approaches for comparison
- Consider edge cases during research
- Note security implications early
