# MCP management

Core MCP workflows use capabilities already connected to the host. Read [the skill entrypoint](SKILL.md) and [protocol concepts](references/mcp-protocol.md) for the relevant task.

1. Discover the host tool catalog and select only relevant tools/resources/prompts.
2. Read their schemas and perform the authorized operation.
3. Report actual results, artifacts and missing access.

The former standalone client, script CLI and generated tool catalog are not part of this skill. There is no local npm installation step. Optional server configuration examples live in the kit templates; Codex uses project TOML and Claude uses root `.mcp.json`. Do not configure both hosts by symlinking their files together.

Gemini CLI remains an optional separately configured fallback when explicitly chosen and installed; see [optional usage](references/gemini-cli-integration.md). Core does not require it or a separate API key.
