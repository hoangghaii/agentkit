description: "Discover and use configured host MCP tools, resources and prompts for integration tasks."

Resource paths are relative to this skill directory, independent of the shell working directory. Use absolute script paths when running from a project subdirectory. Host tool names vary: use equivalent available tools and report missing capabilities. Read project dependencies to identify the version in use before applying API examples; older bundled examples require checking official documentation.

# mcp-management

Use the host tool catalog and connected capabilities first. Filter by task and read tool schemas before calling. Do not install a second MCP client to access tools already exposed by the host. Keep server configuration project local, credentials in environment variables, and report missing permissions without inventing results. Gemini CLI is an optional fallback only when explicitly chosen. See the bundled references for protocol concepts; host schemas take precedence.
