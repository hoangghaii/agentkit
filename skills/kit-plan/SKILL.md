# kit-plan

Read project instructions and relevant code, then choose the mode before creating artifacts. Apply YAGNI, KISS and DRY. Use equivalent host tools; delegate substantial independent work only when useful and available.

## Brainstorming: --brainstorm

Use the `brainstormer` role or perform its work directly. Clarify the objective and constraints, compare feasible options, challenge assumptions, identify risks and recommend an approach with reasons. Report a decision summary and unresolved questions. This mode does not implement code or automatically create an implementation plan and phase files. Save the decision summary only when requested. Move to implementation planning when that is requested; do not require repeated confirmation for work already authorized.

## Implementation planning

Load the sibling `planning` skill and its [plan organization](../planning/references/plan-organization.md) and [output standards](../planning/references/output-standards.md). Unless the user requests inline-only output, create `plans/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-<topic>/` in the target project using current local time. Reuse the supplied plan when revising or continuing it.

- `plan.md`: concise scope, approach, dependencies and a status table linking to every phase.
- `phase-01-<name>.md`, `phase-02-<name>.md`, and so on: one file per meaningful phase, with scope, affected files, ordered steps, todo checkboxes, acceptance checks and material risks.

Read back saved files and verify relative links. Return the actual overview path and phase summary; never claim proposed files exist. If writes are unavailable, return proposed paths and complete contents for handoff. A delegated read-only planner supplies per-file contents; the coordinator persists and verifies them.

## Planning modes

- `--fast`: no external research. Use supplied reports, available local documentation and scoped code analysis, then write the overview and required phase files. Disclose missing evidence rather than silently browsing.
- `--hard`: expand investigation and risk analysis where complexity warrants it.
- `--two`: produce two detailed, feasible implementation plans, not merely two option descriptions. Write a root comparison overview linking to two approach subdirectories, each with its own `plan.md` and phase files, then recommend an approach with tradeoffs. If only one approach is feasible, explain that limitation rather than fabricating another. Do not implement either approach during planning.
- `--ci`: retrieve the supplied Actions job logs through host GitHub capabilities or `gh`, inspect workflow/configuration and identify the observed failure before planning repairs. Compare feasible repairs and recommend one; record unavailable logs as a limitation. Do not implement fixes during this mode.
- `--cro`: plan improvements to website conversion from the actual supplied page/reference and source. Assess headline/value clarity, CTA, message consistency, friction, trust, objections, mobile accessibility and measurable experiments without invented uplift percentages; planning does not apply the copy edits.

Create research/report directories only for artifacts actually produced. Leave implementation to the subsequent authorized task. Hand off the overview path, phase order, assumptions and unresolved questions.
