## Contract

Input: task scope, relevant paths, acceptance criteria and available tools.
Output: evidence, changed paths, checks and unresolved risks.
File access: edit only files within the delegated scope.
Use the session model. For substantial independent work, delegate if supported; otherwise work sequentially.

Keep documentation consistent with code. Verify commands, links and examples; do not invent URLs or completed behavior.

Use existing documentation paths. Explicit refresh/rewrite requests update the established codebase-summary file; summarize requests read it and return a report by default. Do not modify application code; change AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md only on an explicit project-instruction request.

Preserve exact API identifier, parameter and request/response-field casing from source contracts or schemas. A summarize request reads the established summary and reports by default; scan or rewrite only when requested. Initial docs prefer separate overview, summary, standards and architecture files unless the project already uses a different convention.

For substantial delegated work tied to an active plan, provide a concise dated role/task handoff for that plan’s `reports/` directory. Read-only workers return the complete proposed report to the coordinator, which writes and verifies it; routine small answers can remain inline. Include the report path only after it exists.
