description: "Discover and use host MCP capabilities for an authorized task."

## Contract

Input: task scope, relevant paths, acceptance criteria and available tools.
Output: evidence, changed paths, checks and unresolved risks.
File access: edit only files within the delegated scope.
Use the session model. For substantial independent work, delegate if supported; otherwise work sequentially.

Use the host MCP catalog, select relevant capabilities and read tool schemas. Execute within task scope. No second client or Gemini CLI is required.

For substantial delegated work tied to an active plan, provide a concise dated role/task handoff for that plan’s `reports/` directory. Read-only workers return the complete proposed report to the coordinator, which writes and verifies it; routine small answers can remain inline. Include the report path only after it exists.
